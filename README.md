# GreenChain
GreenChain leverages blockchain technology to promote sustainable agriculture practices. By integrating IoT devices and smart contracts, GreenChain ensures transparent and efficient management of agricultural processes from farm to table.
Key Features:
Transparency and Traceability: Farmers can upload real-time data about crop growth, pesticide use, and harvesting practices to the blockchain. Consumers can trace the entire journey of their food, ensuring it meets organic and sustainable standards.
Incentive Mechanism: Farmers are rewarded with GreenTokens for adopting eco-friendly practices. These tokens can be exchanged for farming supplies, services, or fiat currency.
Smart Contracts for Supply Chain Management: Automated contracts ensure fair trade and timely payments, reducing the risk of fraud and inefficiencies.
Decentralized Marketplace: A platform for farmers to sell their produce directly to consumers, reducing intermediaries and increasing farmers' profits.
Potential Impact:
GreenChain can revolutionize the agriculture industry by promoting sustainable practices, increasing transparency, and providing financial incentives to farmers. This project can also help consumers make more informed choices about their food sources.
